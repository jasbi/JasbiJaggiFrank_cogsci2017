\begin{abstract}
At first glance, children's word learning appears to be mostly a problem
of learning words like ``dog'' and ``run.'' However, it is small words
like \emph{and} and \emph{or} that enable the construction of complex
combinatorial language. How do children learn such function words? Using
transcripts of parent-child interactions, we investigate the cues in
child-directed speech that can inform the interpretation and acquisition
of the connective \emph{or}, which has a particularly challenging
semantics. Study 1 finds that, despite its low overall frequency,
children use \emph{or} at adult levels by age 4 in some speech acts.
Study 2 uses annotations of a subset of parent-child interactions to
show that disjunctions in child-directed speech are accompanied by
reliable cues to the correct interpretation (exclusive vs.~inclusive).
We present a decision-tree model that learns from a handful of annotated
examples to correctly predict the interpretation of a disjuntion. These
studies suggest that conceptual and prosodic cues in child-directed
speech can provide information for the acquisition of functional
categories like disjunction.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Word learning is the process of isolating a word form, selecting a
meaning from a set of potential meanings, and mapping the word to the
selected meaning (Clark, 1995). For example, a father holding a baby may
point to a squirrel and say ``look at the squirrel!'' The baby --
already familiar with the phrase ``look at the'' -- should recognize the
novel word \emph{squirrel}, consider some potential referents (e.g tree,
squirrel, chair, etc.) and select the right referent using the available
cues, in this case the father's pointing. While there has been a lot of
research on cues that help children's acquisition of content words such
as \emph{squirrel}, \emph{red}, and \emph{run}, we know little about
cues that can assist children in learning the meaning of function words
such as \emph{and}, \emph{the}, \emph{of}, and \emph{or}. This is partly
due to the nature of these two categories. Content words have thousands
of members and their meanings are often concrete and tangible. Function
words, however, have few members and refer to highly abstract meanings
that hold content words together to form complete sentences and
thoughts. These properties make function words challenging for theories
of word learning. In this study, we investigate the cues that assist
children's acquisition of function words by examining the disjunction
word \emph{or} in parent-child interactions.

The word \emph{or} has been a case study for linguistic semantics due to
a seeming ambiguity between an inclusive and exclusive interpretation.
In formal logics, there are two types of disjunction: inclusive and
exclusive. An inclusive disjunction such as ``A \(\vee\) B'' is true
when either A, B, or both are true. An exclusive disjunction such as ``A
\(\oplus\) B'' is true only when A or B is true but not both. The
linguistic connective \emph{or} appears to be ambiguous between an
inclusive interpretation like ``A \(\vee\) B'' and an exclusive one like
``A \(\oplus\) B''. For example, a waiter may ask if you would like
something to eat or drink, not excluding the possibility that you would
like both. However, the waiter may later ask if you would like to see
the dessert menu or have the check, suggesting that you should choose
one or the other, and not both.

Closer examinations suggest that while the meaning of \emph{or} itself
is inclusive, the exclusive interpretation can be derived by ruling out
the situation where both options are true via pragmatic reasoning,
inconsistent options, or a rise-fall intonation. Grice (1975) argued
that upon hearing ``A or B,'' we may exclude the possibility of both A
and B being true simply because we reason that the speaker could have
used the connective \emph{and} instead of \emph{or}. Therefore, the
exclusive interpretation is the result of this pragmatic reasoning on
the speaker's connective use. Following this line of reasoning, Geurts
(2006) argued that in many cases, exclusive interpretations stem from
the inconsistent meaning of the options themselves. For example, ``to be
or not to be'' is exclusive simply because one cannot both be and not
be! In an experimental study, Pruitt \& Roelofsen (2013) showed that in
questions, exclusive interpretations are the result of a rise-fall
intonation on the disjunction. These studies suggest that the exclusive
interpretation of \emph{or} is the result of modifying \emph{or}'s
underlyingly inclusive semantics by external factors.

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

How do children learn the inclusive semantics of \emph{or}? One
possibility is that inclusive interpretations dominate the examples of
\emph{or} children hear. Morris (2008) investigated instances of
\emph{and} and \emph{or} in parents' and children's speech using 240
transcripts in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). He found that
compared to \emph{and}, \emph{or} is extremely rare in child-directed
speech and that children start to produce and subsequently reach the
adult rate earlier for \emph{and}. He also found that the majority of
\emph{or} examples children hear (75-80\%) and produce (90\%) have an
exclusive interpretation. Based on these findings, he concluded that
children's early meaning for \emph{or} is exclusive disjunction and that
they learn the inclusive meaning in later stages of development
(possibly at age 6 or 7).

Contrary to Morris (2008)'s conclusion, a series of experimental studies
found that children between the ages of 3 and 5 interpret \emph{or} as
inclusive disjunction (Chierchia, Crain, Guasti, Gualmini, \& Meroni,
2001; Crain, 2012; Jasbi \& Frank, 2016). Given Morris (2008)'s finding
that the majority of \emph{or} examples children hear are exclusive, how
can children learn to interpret \emph{or} as inclusive? Crain (2012)
considered it unlikely that children learn the meaning of \emph{or} from
the examples they hear. Instead, he argued that children rely on an
innate knowledge that the meaning of a disjunction word is inclusive. In
other words, upon hearing a connective word, children consider inclusive
disjunction (A \(\vee\) B) as a viable candidate for the meaning, not
exclusive disjunction (A \(\oplus\) B).

Here we present two studies investigating the role of input in
children's acquisition of disjunction. In study 1, we use a larger
corpus (9,097 transcripts in CHILDES) than that of Morris (2008) to
investigate the frequencies of \emph{and} and \emph{or} in parent-child
interactions. We find that when we consider the speech acts they are
most used for, both \emph{and} and \emph{or} appear relatively early in
children's speech and reach the adult rate of production at or by the
age 4. In study 2, we conduct an annotation study to check the
frequencies of \emph{or}'s exlusive and inclusive interpretations as
well as conceptual and prosodic cues that accompany it. We replicate
Morris (2008)'s finding that the majority of \emph{or} examples in
child-directed speech have an exclusive interpretation. However, we also
show that these exclusive interpretations correlate systematically with
conceptual and prosodic cues. Exclusive interpretations are either
conceptually inconsistent or carry a distinct rise-fall intonation. We
show that setting aside these cases, the interpretation of a disjunction
is most often inclusive. We build a learning model that uses intonation
and conceptual consistency to predict the interpretation of a
disjunction with high accuracy even given relatively few examples. These
results suggest that children can rely on cues present in child-directed
speech to tease apart the exclusive vs.~inclusive interpretation of
disjunction and map the meaning of \emph{or} accordingly.

\section{Study 1: Corpus Study}\label{study-1-corpus-study}

First, we conducted an exploratory investigation of \emph{and} and
\emph{or} productions in parents' and children's speech. The goal of the
study was to find out when children start producing these words and when
they reach the adult rate of production.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

We accessed the Child Language Data Exchange System
(\href{https://childes.talkbank.org/}{CHILDES}, MacWhinney (2000)) via
the online platform \href{http://childes-db.stanford.edu/}{childes-db}
and its associated R package (Sanchez et al., in prep). We extracted all
instances of \emph{and} and \emph{or} in the English corpora (ENG-NA and
ENG-UK), with information on the child's age at the time of the
utterance as well as the utterance type. Utterances were coded as
``declarative'', ``question'', ``imperative'', or ``other'' according to
\href{https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.html\#_Toc486414422}{the CHILDES
CHAT trascription format}. Since utterance types ``imperatives'' and
``other'' constituted a very small portion of utterances, we did not
include them in our analysis. In our analysis, we used utterance type as
a proxy for speech acts (Austin, 1975). We limited our analysis to the
data between the ages 1 and 6 because there was limited data outside
this age range. We computed the relative frequency of connective
production by dividing the total number of \emph{and} and \emph{or}
tokens in the speech of fathers, mothers, and children at a particular
age by the total number of words spoken at that age. We present the
relative frequency as parts per thousand.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics{figs/OverallConnectivePlots-1} \includegraphics{figs/OverallConnectivePlots-2} \caption[The relative frequency of AND (top) and OR (bottom) per thousand words in the speech of fathers, mothers, and children between the ages of 1 and 6]{The relative frequency of AND (top) and OR (bottom) per thousand words in the speech of fathers, mothers, and children between the ages of 1 and 6.}\label{fig:OverallConnectivePlots}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure*}[t]

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/byspeechActPlots-1} \includegraphics{figs/byspeechActPlots-2} 

}

\caption[The relative frequency of AND (left) and OR (right) per thousand words in declaratives and questions in the speech of fathers (Light Green), mothers (Dark Green), and children (Blue) between the ages of 1 and 6]{The relative frequency of AND (left) and OR (right) per thousand words in declaratives and questions in the speech of fathers (Light Green), mothers (Dark Green), and children (Blue) between the ages of 1 and 6.}\label{fig:byspeechActPlots}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

In Figure \ref{fig:OverallConnectivePlots}, we show the relative
frequencies of \emph{and} and \emph{or} in the speech of parents and
children between the ages of 1 and 6 years. In the speech of parents,
\emph{and} is produced around 20 times per thousand words while
\emph{or} is only produced around 2 times per thousand words. This
result confirms previous findings that \emph{or} is much less frequent
in child directed speech than a similar function word such as
\emph{and}.

\emph{and} and \emph{or} seem to show different developmental
trajectories in the speech of children. For \emph{and}, there is a rapid
increase in its production between the ages of 1.5 and 3. It reaches the
adult rate around the age 3 and stays at that level afterwards. For
\emph{or}, on the other hand, we see a slow increase from age 2, getting
close to the adult rate only at age 6. This difference in the
development of \emph{and} \& \emph{or} production is similar to the
developmental trends reported by Morris (2008). However, the analysis
above does not control for the role of speech act (e.g.~questions and
declaratives) in the frequency of function words. While content words
such as \emph{dog} or \emph{chair} may appear freely in different types
of speech acts, function words can be constrained by the type of speech
acts they can appear in. \emph{and} is more frequent in declaratives
(71\%) while \emph{or} has similar frequencies in declaratives and
questions (46\% vs.~48\%). In addition, declaratives are more frequent
than questions overall (73\% vs.~22\%). Thus, these base-rate
differences may mask different developmental trajectories.

We therefore computed the relative frequency of \emph{and}/\emph{or}
across questions and declaratives separately. Relative frequency is
computed as \(freq(target) / total-tokens\), where both are computed
within the utterances of a particular speaker (father, mother, child) in
a particular speech act (questions, declaratives). Overall, we found
that the relative frequency of \emph{and} is higher in declaratives than
in questions (18.75 vs.~12.27 words per thousand). The relative
frequency of \emph{or}, however, is higher in questions (0.9 vs.~2.2
words per thousand). Figure \ref{fig:byspeechActPlots} shows the
developmental trend of these relative frequencies, split by speech act.

Within this analysis, \emph{and} appears to be produced at adult levels
by around age 3 in declaratives, its modal speech act. And \emph{or}
appears to be produced at relatively adult-like levels by around 4 in
questions, its modal speech act. In contrast, in declaratives, which are
more frequent overall, \emph{or} frequency is below adult rates
throughout, perhaps due to its use in complex, multi-clausal sentences,
which are less frequent for children of all ages than for adults. In
sum, children's overall lower-frequency use of \emph{or} may mask
earlier competence in producing \emph{or} in questions.

\section{Study 2: Annotation Study}\label{study-2-annotation-study}

Study 1 showed that even though \emph{or} is not very frequent in
child-directed speech, children learn and produce it in questions and
reach the adult rate of production around the age 4. In study 2, we
conducted an annotation study of \emph{or} productions in child-directed
speech. The goal of this study was to discover features of
child-directed speech that may help the acquisition of \emph{or}'s
meaning from infrequent data.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}

We accessed
\href{https://phonbank.talkbank.org/browser/index.php?url=Eng-NA/Providence/}{the
Providence corpus} (Demuth, Culbertson, \& Alter, 2006) via the phonbank
section of \href{https://talkbank.org/}{the TalkBank system}. We
extracted all instances of \emph{or} along with the two utterances
before and after to provide context using
\href{http://alpha.talkbank.org/clan/}{the CLAN software}. We annotated
the examples for three major categories: disjunction interpretation,
intonation, and conceptual consistency. Table 1 shows these categories
along with their subcategories and an example for each subcategory.

\subsubsection{Disjunction
Interpretation}\label{disjunction-interpretation}

This category was our dependent measure. Annotators listened to a
disjunction like ``A or B'' and decided whether the speaker intended to
imply ``not both A and B'' (exclusive) or ``possibly both A and B''
(inclusive).

\subsubsection{Intonation}\label{intonation}

For this category annotators listened to the utterances containing
disjunction and decided whether the intonation contour on the
disjunction is rise-fall, rise, or flat. Table 1 includes examples that
are prototypically read aloud with the intonation contour they are
subcategorized as.

\subsubsection{Consistency}\label{consistency}

For conceptual consistency, annotators decided whether the propositions
that make up the disjunction are inconsistent. Our annotators used the
following diagnostic to decide the consistency of the disjuncts: Two
disjuncts were marked as inconsistent if replacing the word \emph{or}
with \emph{and} produced a contradiction. For example, changing ``the
ball is in my room and your room'' to ``the ball is in my room and your
room'' produces a contradiction because the propositions cannot be both
true at the same time.

It is important to note here that this criterion is quite strict. In
many cases, the possibility of both propositions being true is ruled out
based on prior knowledge and expectations of the situation. For example,
when asking people whether they would like tea or coffee, it is often
assumed and expected that people choose one or the other. However,
wanting to drink both tea and coffee is not conceptually inconsistent.
It is just very unlikely. Our annotations of consistency are very
conservative in that they consider such unlikely cases as consistent. In
future research, relaxing this definition to allow for exclusion based
on prior expectations may allow us to capture more exclsuive
interpretations of disjunction.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
 Category & Subcategory & Examples \\ 
  \hline
Interpretation & Exclusive & Wanna stay or go? \\ 
   & Inclusive & Anything to eat or drink? \\ 
   \hline
Intonation & Flat & I'll get tea or coffee. \\ 
   & Rise & Anything to eat or drink? \\ 
   & Rise-Fall & Wanna stay or go? \\ 
   \hline
Consistency & Consistent & I'll get tea or coffee. \\ 
   & Inconsistent & Wanna stay or go? \\ 
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Annotation categories and examples.} 
\end{table}

Finally, to test inter-rater reliability, the two raters annotated the
same 240 utterances. The inter-rater reliability was calculated over 8
iterations of 30 examples each. Training only completed after 3
consecutive iterations had substantial agreement between the raters
(Cohen's \(\kappa > 0.7\)) for all categories.

\subsection{Results}\label{results-1}

Error bars represent bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals}\label{fig:interpretationByIntonationAndConsistency}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

First, similar to Morris (2008), we found that the majority of \emph{or}
examples in CDS receive an exclusive interpretation (\(\sim\)\%65).
Figure \ref{fig:interpretation} shows this difference in distribution.
However, the rate of exclusive interpretations change systematically
when we break the data down by intonation and consistency (Figure
\ref{fig:interpretationByIntonationAndConsistency}). Given a rise-fall
intonation contour, a disjunction is almost always interpreted as
exclusive. Similarly, if the propositions are inconsistent, the
disjunction is most likely interpreted as exclusive. When either of
these two features are absent, a disjunction is more likely to receive
an inclusive interpretation.

A mixed-effects binomial logistic regression using the package \{lme4\}
(Bates, Maechler, Bolker, Walker, \& others, 2014) in R with the fixed
effects of intonation and consistency, as well as the random effects for
children, found both intonation and consistency significant in
interpreting disjunctions (exclusivity \(\sim\) intonation + consistency
+ (1\textbar{}id)). Disjunctions were more likely to be interpreted as
exclusive if they received a rise-fall intonation (\(\beta\)=-3.75,
\(z\)=-8.49, \(p < 0.001\)) or if they were inconsistent
(\(\beta\)=-2.17, \(z\)=-8, \(p < 0.001\)). Disjunctions were more
likely to be interpreted as inclusive if they were consistent and
received a rising (\(\beta\)=0.67, \(z\)=2.44, \(p < 0.001\)) or flat
intonation (\(\beta\)=0.71, \(z\)=3.44, \(p < 0.001\)).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsubsection{Classification Model}\label{classification-model}

The preceding analysis suggests that intonation and consistency are
related to the interpretation of disjunction. To investigate how
informative these patterns were more quantitatively, we built a model to
predict the interpretation of a disjunction after training on examples
annotated for intonation and consistency. For ease of interpretation of
the rules governing exclusivity, we fit a decision tree model using
Sci-kit Learn's Decision Tree Module (Pedregosa et al., 2011). We
randomly sampled 100 examples for training and 300 examples for testing.
Averaged over 100 trials, the average accuracy of a binary tree was
83\%. More remarkably, the tree achieved an average of 80\% accuracy
after training on only 20 examples (Figure \ref{fig:learningCurve}). The
control flow of the average decision tree on a single example is as
follows. If \emph{or} has neither rise-fall nor inconsistent disjuncts,
it is marked inclusive. Otherwise, exclusive (Figure
\ref{fig:treeDiagram}). The success of such a simple tree indicates that
children could use a simple model to rapidly learn the exclusive
interpretation of \emph{or} from little data.

\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}

In study 2, we confirm Morris (2008)'s finding that exclusive
interpretations of \emph{or} are far more common than inclusive
interpretations. However, we also show that the majority of these
exclusive interpretations coincide with systematic indicators.
Disjunctions that are accompanied by rise-fall intonation or
inconsistent disjuncts are far more likely to be exclusive. Disjunctions
that do not bear these features are more likely to be inclusive.
Accounting for these external factors, a simple decision tree can
rapidly learn to predict the exclusive interpretation of the
disjunction.

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

We addressed two puzzles in children's acquisition of disjunction.
First, previous comprehension and production studies provided different
accounts for the acquisition of \emph{and} and \emph{or}. Comprehension
studies suggested that children learn the meaning of both \emph{and} and
\emph{or} early and show an adult-like understanding of them by the age
4. However, production studies suggested that \emph{and} reaches the
adult rate of production by the age 3 while \emph{or} does not reach the
adult level even at age 5. Study 1 showed that when we control for the
speech acts that these connectives are most used for, we observe that
both \emph{and} and \emph{or} appear to increase in prevalence somewhat
earlier than in previous studies and come relatively close to adult
levels at or before age 4. This observation unifies the picture from
comprehension and production studies: Children's acquisition of
\emph{and}/\emph{or} appears to take place between the ages of 2 and 4.

The second puzzle that this paper addressed was the problem of learning
an inclusive semantics for \emph{or} from the majority exclusive
instances in children's input. Previous studies showed that most
\emph{or} examples children hear receive an exclusive interpretation,
yet in comprehension tasks they interpret \emph{or} as inclusive. We
suggest that other independent cues in the input may allow children to
solve this problem. In Study 2, we replicated the pattern that most
interpretations of \emph{or} were exclusive. But most of these exclusive
interpretations were either constituted of two conceptually inconsistent
disjuncts or accompanied by a distinctive rise-fall intonation.
Disjunctions that did not show either of these two cues were typically
inclusive. If children track these cues, then they could tease apart the
semantic contribution of \emph{or} from the interpretive contribution of
the cues that accompany it.

We implemented this cue-based account in a decision-tree model, which
learned to predict the interpretation of a disjunction with high
accuracy after observing only a few examples. This model describes the
statistical properties of the data available to children, rather than
describing their learning process. Nevertheless, the sucess of this
model suggests that the systematicity of children's linguistic input
might allow them to decide correctly between exclusive and inclusive
semantics for disjunction. Such a learning account would obviate the
need for a principle that directly blocks exclusive disjunction as a
possible connective meaning. \emph{or} may not be assigned an exclusive
meaning simply because such a mapping is not supported by the language
input children hear.

The findings here do not bear on other components of the logical
nativist account. A learning account still needs to address whether
candidate semantic representations -- inclusive and exclusive \emph{or},
as well as candidates for other connectives -- are innate or discovered
during development. Moreover, while conceptual consistency is likely a
reliable cue crosslinguically, intonation may be a more
language-dependent cue and should be investigated further. Other
pragmatic and contextual effects that we did not examine might also bear
on children's interpretation of disjunction, and we expect that
exclusive interpretations not captured by our model might be captured by
these factors.

Form-meaning mapping in child language acquisition is often construed as
the task of associating a novel, isolated form such as \emph{gavagai} to
a well-delimited concept such as rabbit. The case of disjunction is more
complicated. \emph{or} cannot be isolated from either the conceptual
properties of the words and phrases that it combines with or the
prosodic contour of the utterance as a whole. Learning \emph{or} and
other function words requires a fuller consideration of the formal and
conceptual contexts in which they occur; our models must take these into
account.
