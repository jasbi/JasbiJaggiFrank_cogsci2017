\begin{abstract}
Current theories of word learning focus on cues and mechanisms that help
children's acquisition of open-class words such as nouns and verbs.
Little is understood about the role of input in children's acquisition
of closed-class words such as articles and connectives. This paper
investigates the cues in child-directed speech that can help the
interpretation and acquisition of the connective disjunction-word
\emph{or}. Study 1 uses a large corpus of parent-child interactions to
show that despite low occurance of \emph{or} in child-directed speech,
children quickly reach the adult level of production for this word by
age 4. Study 2 uses annotations on a subset of parent-child interactions
to show that disjunctions in child-directed speech are accompanied by
reliable cues to the correct interpretation (exclusive vs.~inclusive).
We present a computational model that learns from a handful of annotated
examples to correctly predict the interpretation of a disjuntion. These
studies suggest that reliable cues in child-directed speech can assist
rapid acquisition of functional categories such as disjunction words.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

When we think of words, we often think of nouns like \emph{cat},
adjectives like \emph{red}, or verbs like \emph{run}. These classes of
words - called \textbf{content words} - have thousands of members and
constantly add new ones like \emph{Google}, \emph{crunk}, or
\emph{chillax}. Their meanings often refer to concrete and tangible
entities or events in the world. This is not the case for
\textbf{function words} like \emph{and}, \emph{or}, \emph{of}, and
\emph{the}. Functional classes have few members and rarely accept new
ones. Their meanings are highly abstract and provide the glue that holds
content words together to form complete thoughts. These properties make
function words challenging for theories of word learning. While there
has been a lot of research on cues and mechanisms that assist children's
acquisition of content words, very little is known about cues that help
children learn the meaning of function words. In this study, we make the
initial steps by looking at the disjunction word \emph{or} in parents'
and children's speech.

The word \emph{or} has long been a lab rat in linguistics and language
acquisition. This interest in \emph{or} is mainly due to its close
connection to logical disjunciton. In formal logics, there are two types
of disjunction: inclusive and exclusive. An \textbf{inclusive
disjunction} such as ``A \(\vee\) B'' is true when either A, B, or both
are true. An \textbf{exclusive disjunction} such as ``A \(\oplus\) B''
is true only when A or B is true but not both. The linguistic connective
\emph{or} can receive an inclusive interpretation like ``A \(\vee\) B''
or an exclusive one like ``A \(\oplus\) B''. For example, a waitor may
ask if you would like something to eat or drink, not excluding the
possibility that you would like both. However, the waitor may later ask
if you would like to see the dessert menu or have the cheque, suggesting
that you should chose one or the other.

A large body of research in formal semantics and pragmatics seeks to
specify the meaning of \emph{or} and factors that determine its
interpreation as inclusive and exclusive. Grice (1975) argued that the
core meaning of \emph{or} is inclusive disjunction. The exclusive
interpretation is the result of modifying this inclusive meaning by
factors external to \emph{or} itself. He suggested that upon hearing ``A
or B'', we may exclude the possibility of both A and B being true simply
because we reason that the speaker could have used the connective
\emph{and} instead of \emph{or}. Therefore, the exclusive interpretation
is the result of this pragmatic reasoning on the speaker's choice of
\emph{or} instead of \emph{and} and not part of the meaning of \emph{or}
itself. Geurts (2006) argued that in many cases, exclusive
interpretations stem from the inconsistent meaning of the options. For
example, ``to be or not to be'' is exclusive simply because one cannot
both be and not be! In an experimental study, Pruitt \& Roelofsen (2013)
showed that in questions, exclusive interpretations are the result of a
rise-fall intonation. In short, while the meaning of \emph{or} itself is
inclusive, the situation where both options are true may be excluded by
pragmatic reasoning, inconsistent options, or a rise-fall intonation.

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

How do children learn the meaning of \emph{or} given all this complexity
in interpreting a disjunction? Morris (2008) investigated instances of
\emph{and} and \emph{or} in parents' and children's speech. He found
that \emph{and} occurs about 3 times every 100 utterances in the speech
of parents while \emph{or} occurs only once or twice every 400
utterances. More importantly, children reach the adult level of
production for \emph{and} relatively quickly and around the age 3 but
their productions of \emph{or} do not reach the adult level in the first
five years. He also found that the majority of \emph{or} examples
children hear (75-80\%) and produce (\%90) have an exclusive
interpretation. Based on these findings, he concluded that children's
acquisition of \emph{or} is slow and they understand its meaning as
exclusive before they add the inclusive meaning to their repertoire.

On constructivist accounts of the acquisition of disjunction, children
learn the meaning of \emph{or} by paying attention to how parents use it
in different contexts. They form usage-rules and expand their usage
repertoire as they grow up. The prediction is that children's production
of \emph{or} is slow and gradual, mirroring what they hear from parents.
Morris (2008) found that \emph{and} is about 13 times more frequent than
\emph{or} in parents' speech to children. As predicted by the
constructivist account, Morris (2008) reported that children also learn
to produce \emph{and} much more quickly than \emph{or}. They reach the
adult rate of \emph{and} at age 3 while for \emph{or} there is a gradual
increase in production, possibly reaching the adult level at ages 5 or
6. The faster acquisition of \emph{and} is consistent with the
constructivist theory that emphasizes the role of usage frequency in
children's linguistic development. Morris (2008) also reported that the
majority of \emph{or} examples children hear are exclusive. He reported
that the majority of \emph{or}'s children produce are also exclusive.
Therefore, the inclusive semantics of \emph{or} is developed after the
exclusive interpretation.

However, several comprehension studies of \emph{or} in different
linguistic contexts show that children as young as three-years old
interpret \emph{or} as inclusive disjunction (Crain, 2012). This finding
is surprising given Morris (2008)`s finding that the majority of
\emph{or} examples children hear are exclusive. How do children learn
the interpretation of disjunction as inclusive if they rarely hear it?
We call this the \textbf{learning puzzle of disjunction}. Crain (2012)
suggests that instead of learning from the parents' usage of \emph{or},
children rely on the innate knowledge that the disjunction operator in
their native language must have an inclusive meaning. This nativist
account predicts that \emph{or} is learned relatively quickly and
accurately by children.

Here we present an alternative answer that provides a synthesis between
the nativist and constructivist accounts. We show that children can use
regularities in parents' usage of \emph{or} to learn the interpretation
of disjunction from a handful of examples. In study 1, we use a large
scale corpus study of parents and children's speech to show that both
\emph{and} and \emph{or} appear relatively quickly in children's speech
and reach the adult rate by the age 4. This finding is consistent with
the comprehension studies that show children have an adult-like
understanding of these words by the age four. In study 2, we replicate
Morris (2008)'s finding that the majority of \emph{or} examples in
child-directed speech have an exclusive interpretation. However, we also
show that these exclusive interpretations correlate systematically with
two factors external to \emph{or}: intonation and consistency of the
options. Exclusive interpretations are either inconsistent in nature
(e.g.~clean or dirty) or carry a distinct rise-fall intonation. We show
that setting aside these cases, the interpretation of a disjunction is
inclusive.

We argue that if children track the interpretive cues that accompany a
disjunction, they can tease apart the role of the word \emph{or} from
factors that accompany and enhance it to shape the exclusive
interpretation. This way children can discover that exclusivity
corrleates with rise-fall intonation and inconsistent options, while
\emph{or} itself does not exclude the option of both disjuncts being
true. We implement this novel account in a decision-tree that correctly
learns to predict the interpretation of a disjunction with 80\% accuracy
after only a few examples. Our results show that the richness and
systematicity of children's linguistic input allows rapid acquisition of
disjunction with no need for an innate assumptions specific to the
meaning of disjunction. We discuss the important implications of this
work for the theories of word learning in the last section.

\section{Study 1: Corpus Study}\label{study-1-corpus-study}

First, we conducted an exploratory investigation of \emph{and} and
\emph{or} productions in parents and children. The goal of the study was
to find out when children start producing these words and when they
reach the adult rate of production. We conclude that children start
producing \emph{and} around 1.5 or 2 years of age, and \emph{or} between
the ages of 2 and 3. They reach the adult rate of production for
\emph{and} around 3 and for \emph{or} around 4 or possibly earlier.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

We accessed the Child Language Data Exchange System
(\href{https://childes.talkbank.org/}{CHILDES}, MacWhinney (2000)) via
the online platform \href{http://childes-db.stanford.edu/}{childes-db}
and its associated R package childesr (Sanchez et al., in prep). We
extracted all instances of \emph{and} and \emph{or} from the English
corpora (ENG-NA and ENG-UK). We limited our analysis to the data between
one and six years because there is limited data outside this age range.
We computed the relative frequency of connective production by dividing
the total number of \emph{and}/\emph{or} in the speech of fathers,
mothers, and children at a particular age by the total number of words
spoken at that age. We present the relative frequency as parts per
thousand.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[t]

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure*}[t]

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/byspeechActPlots-1} \includegraphics{figs/byspeechActPlots-2} 

}

\caption[The relative frequency of AND (left) and OR (right) per thousand words in declaratives and questions in the speech of fathers, mothers, and children between the ages of 1 and 6]{The relative frequency of AND (left) and OR (right) per thousand words in declaratives and questions in the speech of fathers, mothers, and children between the ages of 1 and 6.}\label{fig:byspeechActPlots}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

In figure 1, we show the relative frequencies of \emph{and} and
\emph{or} in the speech of parents and children between one and six
years. In the speech of parents, \emph{and} is produced around 20 times
per thousand words while \emph{or} is only produced around 2 times per
thousand words. This confirms previous findings that \emph{or} is much
less frequent in child directed speech than a similar function word such
as \emph{and}.

\emph{And} and \emph{or} seem to show different developmental
trajectories in the speech of children. For \emph{and}, there is a rapid
increase in its production between the ages of 1.5 and 3 before it
reaches the adult rate around the age 3 and stay at that level until the
age 6. For \emph{or}, on the other hand, we see a slow incrase from the
age 2 until at least age 6, as it approaches the adult rate. This
difference in the development of \emph{and} \& \emph{or} production was
attributed to the frequency of these items in child-directed speech.
Since \emph{and} is much more frequent than \emph{or}, it is learned
much faster than \emph{or}. Morris (2008) argued that such patterns
support the item-based and usage-based acquisition of logical words.

However, the analysis above does not control for other factors that can
affect the production of words by children. An important factor to
control for is the development of speech acts. While content words such
as \emph{dog} or \emph{chair} may appear freely in different types of
speech acts, function words are highly constrained by the type of speech
acts they can appear in. For example, it is reasonable to assume that
question words such as \emph{how} and \emph{why} are much more likey to
occur in questions than statements (declaratives). If parent-child
interaction is such that parents ask more questions than children, it is
not surprising to find higher rates of \emph{how} and \emph{why}
production in parents than children. Therefore, it is important to
control for the speech act a function word appears in.

Figure 2 shows the relative frequencies of \emph{and} and \emph{or} in
questions vs.~declaratives, in the speech of parents and children
between one and six years. Here, the relative frequency is computed by
dividing the total number of \emph{and}/\emph{or} in a
question/declarative in the speech of fathers, mothers, and children at
a particular age, by the total number of words in a question/declarative
spoken at that age. As before, we present the relative frequency as
parts per thousand.

The results show similar developmental trajectories for the production
of \emph{and} and \emph{or} in children. For both words, there is a
relatively rapid incease in their frequency between the ages of 2 and 4
before reaching the parent rate at the age of 4 and staying at that rate
until the age of 6. This pattern of production is consistent with the
nativist observations that the acquisition of \emph{and} and \emph{or}
is rapid and that children have an adult-like comprehension of these two
connectives at the age 4.

\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}

In this study we found that \emph{and} is a lot more frequent than
\emph{or} in child directed speech. Looking at the relative frequency of
\emph{and} and \emph{or} between the ages of 1 and 6, it appeared as if
children show radically different developmental trajectories for these
two connectives. Children's production of \emph{and} seemed to sharply
increase around the age 1.5 and reach the adult rate around age 3 while
\emph{or} production increased slowly and linearly until it reached the
adult rate at age 6. However, we showed that this discrepency is to a
large part due to the distribution of function words in different speech
acts. Since \emph{or} is more frequent in questions and children produce
fewer questions than parents, the frequency of \emph{or} in children's
speech is underestimated if we normalize by the total number of words
they produce. Instead, when we look at the production of \emph{and} and
\emph{or} in specific speech acts - declaratives and questions - and
normalize by the total number of words produces in each speech act, we
see that \emph{and} and \emph{or} show similar developmental patterns.
We argue that the developmental trajectory of \emph{and} \& \emph{or} is
best described as a quick increase in production between the ages of 2
and 4 and staying around the parents' rate between the ages 4 and 6.
This is compatible with the comprehension studies which suggest children
understand \emph{and} and \emph{or} by the age four.

\section{Study 2: Annotation Study}\label{study-2-annotation-study}

Study 1 showed that even though \emph{or} is not very frequent in
child-directed speech, children learn and produce it relatively quickly
and reach the adult rate around the age 4. In Study 2, we conducted a
detailed and small-scale investigation of \emph{or} productions in
child-directed speech. The goal of the study was to find out how
children learn the meaning of \emph{or} from such little data. We
conclude that children hear significantly more exclusive uses of
\emph{or} supporting Morris (2008)'s findings. However, we also find
that the exclusive uses of \emph{or} are rich in structures that index
the exclusive interpretation. These indicative structures include
rise-fall intonation and consistency of the options. Exclusive
interpretations are either inconsistent in nature (e.g.~clean or dirty)
or carry a distinct rise-fall intonation. We then show that a decision
tree model can learn to accurately (\textgreater{}80\%) predict
exclusivity using this information after seeing few (\textless{}20)
examples. Instances of \emph{or} without these indices are most likely
interpreted as inclusive.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}

We accessed
\href{https://phonbank.talkbank.org/browser/index.php?url=Eng-NA/Providence/}{the
Providence corpus} (Demuth, Culbertson, \& Alter, 2006) via the phonbank
section of \href{https://talkbank.org/}{the TalkBank system}. We
extracted all instances of \emph{or} along with the two utterances
before and after to provide context using
\href{http://alpha.talkbank.org/clan/}{the CLAN software}. We annotated
the examples for three major categories: 1. Interpretation 2. Intonation
and 3. Conceptual consistency. Table 1 shows these categories along with
their subcategories and an example for each subcategory.

\subsubsection{Disjunction}\label{disjunction}

The first category - disjunction interpretation - was our dependent
measure. Annotators listened to a disjunction like ``A or B'' and
decided whether the speaker intended to imply ``not both A and B''
(exlcusive) or ``possibly both A and B'' (inclusive).

\subsubsection{Intonation}\label{intonation}

For the second category - intontation - annotators listened to the
sentence containing disjunction and decided whether the intonation
contour on the disjunction is rise-fall, rise, or flat. Table 1 includes
examples that are prototypically read aloud with the intonation contour
they are subcategorized as.

\subsubsection{Consistency}\label{consistency}

Finally, for conceptual consistency, annotators decided wether the
propositions that make up the disjunction are inconsistent. Our
annotators used the following diagnostic to decide the consistency of
the disjuncts: Two disjuncts were marked as inconsistent if replacing
the word \emph{or} with \emph{and} produced a contradiction. For
example, changing ``the ball is in my room and your room'' to ``the ball
is in my room and your room'' produces a contradiction because the
propositions cannot be both true at the same time. In such cases, the
inclusive meaning is simply not available due to the nature of the
propositions themselves and not the interpretation of the connective. It
is important to note here that this is a particularly strict diagnostic.
In many cases, the possibility of both propositions being true is ruled
out based on prior knowledge and expectations of the situation. For
example, when asking people whether they would like tea or coffee, it is
often assumed that people choose one or the other. However, wanting to
drink both tea and coffee is not conceptually inconsistent. It is just
very unlikely. Our annotations of consistency are very conservative in
that they consider such unlikely cases as consistent.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
 Category & Subcategory & Examples \\ 
  \hline
Interpretation & Exclusive & Wanna stay or go? \\ 
   & Inclusive & Anything to eat or drink? \\ 
   \hline
Intonation & Flat & I'll get tea or coffee. \\ 
   & Rise & Anything to eat or drink? \\ 
   & Rise-Fall & Wanna stay or go? \\ 
   \hline
Consistency & Consistent & I'll get tea or coffee. \\ 
   & Inconsistent & Wanna stay or go? \\ 
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Annotation categories and examples.} 
\end{table}

Finally, to test inter-rater reliability, the two raters annotated the
same 240 utterances. The interrater reliability was calculated over 8
iterations of 30 examples each. Training only completed after 3
consecutive iterations had substantial agreement between the raters
(Cohen's \(\kappa > 0.7\)) for all categories.

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

First, similar to Morris (2008), we found that the majority of \emph{or}
examples in CDS receive an exclusive interpretation (\(\sim\)\%65).
Figure 3 shows this difference in distribution. However, the rate of
exclusive interpretations change systematically when we break the data
down by prosody and consistency (Figure 4). Given a rise-fall intonation
contour, a disjunction is almost always interpreted as exclusive.
Similarly, if the propositions are inconsistent, the disjunction is most
likely interpreted as excluisive. When either of these two features are
absent, a disjunction is more likely to receive an inclusive
interpretation.

A mixed-effects binomial logistic regression using the pakcage \{lme4\}
(Bates, Maechler, Bolker, Walker, \& others, 2014) in R with the fixed
effects of intonation and consistency, as well as the random effects for
children, found both intonation and consistency significant in
interpreting disjunctions. Disjunctions were more likely to be
interpreted as exclusive if they received a rise-fall intonation
(\(\beta\)=-3.79, \(z\)=1.66, \(p < 0.001\)) or if they were
inconsistent (\(\beta\)=-2.2, \(z\)=2.08, \(p < 0.001\)). Disjunctions
were more likely to be interpreted as inclusive if they were consistent
and received a rising (\(\beta\)=0.58, \(z\)=0.24, \(p < 0.001\)) or
flat intonation (\(\beta\)=0.38, \(z\)=0.27, \(p < 0.001\)).

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Next, using Sci-kit Learn's Decision Tree Module (Pedregosa et al.,
2011), we built a predictive model to train on annotated \emph{or}
utterances and predict the exclusivity of unseen \emph{or} utterances
(annotated for intonation and consistency). We randomly sampled 100
examples for training and 300 examples for testing. Averaged over 100
trials, the average accuracy of a binary tree was 83\%. More remarkably,
the tree achieved an average of 80\% accuracy after training on only 20
examples. The control flow of the average decision tree on a single
example is as follows. If \emph{or} has neither rise-fall nor
inconsistent disjuncts, it is marked inclusive. Otherwise, exclusive.
The success of such a simple tree indicates that children could use a
simple model to rapidly learn the exclusive interpretation of \emph{or}
from little data.

\subsection{Summary}\label{summary-1}

In study 2, we confirm Morris (2008)'s finding that exclusive
interpretations of \emph{or} are far more common than inclusive
interpretations. However, we also show that the majority of these
exclusive interpretations coincide with systematic indicators.
Disjunctions that are accompanied by rise-fall intonation or
inconsistent disjuncts are far more likely to be exclusive. Disjunctions
that do no bear these features are more likely to be inclusive.
Accounting for these external factors, a simple decision tree can
rapidly learn to predict the exclusive interpretation of the
disjunction.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Studies presented in this paper resolve two puzzles in children's
acquisition of disjunction. First, previous studies suggested a
discrepency between children's production of \emph{or} and their
comprehension. Comprehension studies showed that children have an
almost-adult-like interpretation of \emph{and} and \emph{or} at around
the age 4. However, production studies suggested that \emph{and} is
learned and produced quickly while children are slower in reaching the
adult rate of production for \emph{or}. Study 1 showed that when we
control for the environments (speech acts) that these connectives are
suitable for, we observe that both \emph{and} and \emph{or} are learned
relatively quickly and produced at an adult rate around the age 4. This
is compatible with the comprehension studies that show 3-to-5-year-olds
understand the meaning of \emph{or} as inclusive disjunction and
\emph{and} as conjunction.

The second puzzle that this study addressed was the (apparent)
discrepency between what they hear from parents and the knowledge they
manifest in comprehension studies. Previous studies showed that the
majority of \emph{or} examples children hear receive an exclusive
interpretation, yet in comprehension tasks they interpret \emph{or} as
inclusive disjunction. Study 2 showed that even though the majority of
\emph{or} examples are exclusive, this exclusivity is due to prosodic
and conceptual properties of the disjunction and not \emph{or} itself.
We showed when we break down interpretations of disjunction in
child-directed speech by prosody and concpetual consistency, the vast
majority of exclusive interpretations are either inconsistent
conceptually (e.g.~clean or dirty) or are accompanied by a distinctive
rise-fall intonation. Otherwise, a disjunction that does not bear these
properties is more likely to be interpreted as inclusive. This finding
suggests that if children break down disjunction interpretations by cues
that accompany them, they can learn the adult like interpretation of
disjunction from child-directed speech. We showed that a decision tree
can use prosody and conceptual consistency to identify the correct
interpretation using less than 20 examples.

The account presented in this paper has implications for the theories of
form-meaning mapping in general and more specifically theories of
function word acquisition. Form-meaning mapping in child language
acquisition is often construed as the task of associating a novel and
isolated form such as \emph{gavagai} to a delimited concept such as
rabbit and storing it in memory. However, the case of disjunction paints
a more complicated picture. For disjunction, it is not enough to isolate
the word \emph{or} for mapping and the learner needs to also consider
the prosodic contour that accompanies \emph{or}. When mapping to
meaning, it is not enough to simply consider the overall interpretation
and the learner should take into account the conceptual properties of
the accompanying words and phrases. In other words, mapping the form
\emph{or} to its meaning involves considering both other forms as well
as concepts that accompany \emph{or} and its core meaning.

Finally, the acquisiton of \emph{or} is important for form-meaning
mapping in function words such as determiners (e.g. \emph{the},
\emph{a}), connectives (e.g. \emph{and}, \emph{or}, \emph{if}), and
auxiliaries (e.g. \emph{might}, \emph{should}, \emph{can}). The word
learning literature has mostly focused on the acquisition of content
words such as nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Theories of word learning
for content words often rely on the physical and observable cues present
in the child's surroundigs to learn the relevant meanings. Such theories
face difficulty when dealing with function words since most function
words do not have observable cues to their meanings. The research
presented here provides early indication on the types of cues that can
help children learn the meaning of function words.
